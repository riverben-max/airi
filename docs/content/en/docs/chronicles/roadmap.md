---

## Core Infrastructure & Network Services

### Cloud & Sync Systems
*Reference: [project-byos-cloud-sync.md](../../../../../project-byos-cloud-sync.md)*
*   **Dropbox & Google Drive Storage Engines**: Extend database/asset storage options to natively support Dropbox and Google Drive as storage providers (in addition to existing S3/R2 and Local FS).
*   **Modular Token Lifecycle Management**: Implement automatic refresh handshakes for Dropbox/Google Drive integrations.

### Web CORS Proxy Bypass (User-Hosted Cloudflare Workers)
*Reference: [proposal-web-cors-proxy-bypass.md](../../../../../proposal-web-cors-proxy-bypass.md)*
*   **Cloudflare Workers Deployer**: Add a "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" button in Settings to automatically bootstrap a private CORS reverse-proxy worker template.
*   **System Connection Settings**: Introduce Worker URL inputs and Web CORS bypass toggles.
*   **Dynamic XHR/Fetch Routing**: Redirect requests to CORS-restricted endpoints (Deepgram, Pioneer, Opencode) through the user's private worker when matching the bypass list.

### Provider Store Restructuring (`providers.ts`)
*Reference: [project-provider-store-restructuring-plan.md](../../../../../project-provider-store-restructuring-plan.md)*
*   **Monolithic Store safe Phase 1 Decomposition**: Extract shared types, helper functions, and the large legacy hand-written provider metadata declarations out of the monolithic `packages/stage-ui/src/stores/providers.ts` (currently ~3k lines) into dedicated registry-family files (`types.ts`, `helpers.ts`, and `registry/*`).
*   **Preserve Store Interface**: Maintain the public API, selectors, and validation behavior of `useProvidersStore` unchanged for consumers while simplifying the core file.

### Core-Agent Revamp (Apeira Runtime Integration)
*Reference: [proposal-core-agent-revamp.md](../../../../../proposal-core-agent-revamp.md)*
*   **Apeira Evaluation**: Monitor and evaluate Apeira (v0.0.5+) as a potential lightweight replacement for `@proj-airi/core-agent` once the codebase and persistence interfaces stabilize.
*   **Plugin Hooks Mapping**: Map our fork-specific orchestration behaviors (e.g. autonomous artistry triggers, live session bidirectional audio) to Apeira's Plugin API.

### Infrastructure & UI Health
*   **Model Selector Stability (Research & Design - Needs Retesting)**: Investigate and resolve the "reactive reset" bug where selecting a temporary preview model in the Model Selector is overridden by the active character's stored model configuration.
*   **Gemini Onboarding Modal Restore**: Move the onboarding dialog window trigger to `ControlStrip` activation: if Gemini Live is activated and there is no Google API key configured, trigger this modal.

*Reference: [proposal-attention-ecology-local-webgpu-guard.md](../../../../../proposal-attention-ecology-local-webgpu-guard.md)*
*   **Local WebGPU Gated Inference**: Continuously poll screen captures every 2 seconds, generate vision embeddings, and filter events locally with a lightweight RWKV model before deciding to promote them to the main Cloud LLM.
*   **Vector-Sampled Attention Pool**: Query vector store of captured frames for the top $N$ most relevant visual landmarks instead of passing a chronological FIFO feed.

### Prefix Cache Alignment & Prompt Compilation Controls
*Reference: [proposal-prefix-cache-alignment.md](../../../../../proposal-prefix-cache-alignment.md)*
*   **Prefix Alignment Logic**: Re-order prompt assembly arrays (System Prompt -> Chat History -> Suffix Telemetry/Deltas) to optimize caching mechanics and maximize prefix hit rates for DeepSeek, Gemini, and OpenRouter. (Analyze and visit 2-3 specific implementation areas).

*Reference: [proposal-vlm-forward-to-llm.md](../../../../../proposal-vlm-forward-to-llm.md)*
*   **Decoupled Sight Pipeline**: Implement a "Forward to LLM" strategy in Settings > Modules > Vision to separate VLM image analysis from character voice. VLM generates descriptions/tags (e.g. WD14 tagger, Kimi 2.5), which are injected into the text stream so the primary LLM can respond in its authentic character voice. (Mostly implemented/working; needs debugging and tuning for timing issues).

### Proactivity System Enrichments
*Reference: [project-proactivity-enrichment-roadmap.md](../../../../../project-proactivity-enrichment-roadmap.md)*
