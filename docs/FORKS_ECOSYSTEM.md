## 🌟 High Interest — Watch Closely

### [NashChennc/airi](https://github.com/NashChennc/airi)
**Also known as:** NaN in the AIRI Discord

**Background:** M.S. student at LDS@USTC (Laboratory for Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China) researching LLM interpretability and alignment. Author of [NExTGuard](https://arxiv.org/), a training-free framework for streaming LLM safety using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). Brings genuine academic AI expertise.

**What they're building:**
- **Alaya Memory Layer** — likely the originator or primary architect of this concept. Designed a planner-centric semantic/episodic memory system with:
  - Neuroscience-inspired time-decay mechanisms
  - Hierarchical consciousness-level memory streams
  - Dispatcher/event-trigger architecture for memory reinforcement and reconsolidation
- **Core Agent extraction** — pulling runtime logic into a `core-agent` module; connected Minecraft and Telegram integrations; working on dispatcher-centric action registries
- **Live2D bug reports** — filed the ZIP archive loading bug (#1933) that was independently fixed in dasilva333/airi ~4-5 weeks prior

**PRs to main:** Yes — multiple, including core agent architecture and Alaya memory design

**Why this matters for dasilva333/airi:**
The Alaya memory architecture is directly adjacent to the work in `PROPOSAL_Dynamic_Memory_RAG_Injection.md`. His academic background in LLM interpretability and SAE-based safety may inform a more principled approach to memory recall and context injection than the purely engineering-driven design in this fork. Worth engaging with directly — there may be complementary ideas or at minimum a shared vocabulary.

**core-agent scoping verdict (assessed June 8, 2026):**
Nash's `core-agent` work is **3 commits, 46 files**, all in a new `packages/core-agent/` package. The restructuring extracts logic that already exists in `packages/stage-ui/src/stores/chat.ts` (~1,320 lines) into a framework-agnostic package with typed ports (`AgentContextPort`, `AgentLLMPort`, `AgentSessionPort`). The benefit is a cleaner package boundary, unit-testability without Pinia, and shareability across runtimes (Discord, Telegram, desktop).

**For this fork specifically — skip the restructuring, cherry-pick one file:**
- The dasilva333 `chat.ts` `performSend` is a **strict superset** of Nash's runtime: it adds vision/VLM handover, grounding injection, autonomous artistry hooks, bridged marker tool loop (`tryBridgeMarker`, up to 5 steps), multi-window `BroadcastChannel` ingest, and `skipAssistant`/`triggerOnly` — none of which exist in his runtime.
- Adopting his package boundary would require re-expressing all of those behaviors as DI ports into a thin facade — a large one-time rewrite with no new capabilities gained.
- The context registry (#1819) is already implemented in this fork as `context-store.ts` with the same `ReplaceSelf`/`AppendSelf` semantics. His version adds `Map` over `Record` (prototype-pollution hardening) and bounded history (400 entries) — marginal improvements.
- **One file is worth a direct copy:** `packages/core-agent/src/messages/context-prompt.ts` (~30 lines). The `formatContextPromptText()` function produces the `[Context]\n- sourceKey: text` bullet format that is exactly the injection block shape designed in `PROPOSAL_Dynamic_Memory_RAG_Injection.md`. Take this function, not the package.

### [YoukiAkito/airi](https://github.com/YoukiAkito/airi)
**Also known as:** LiMomo

**What they're building:**
- **Alaya memory layer review and optimization** — active PR work on the memory subsystem, likely in collaboration with or building on NashChennc's foundational work
- CI/CD workflow improvements

**PRs to main:** Yes — memory optimization work actively in progress

**Why this matters:**
Two people working on Alaya independently is a signal the architecture has real momentum upstream. Their optimization work may be directly importable once Alaya stabilizes enough to evaluate.

### [lulu0119/airi](https://github.com/lulu0119/airi)

**What they're building:**
- **Scale settings UI** — added character view scale controls (PR #1554 and related)
- **AIRI Whiteboard** — proposed and potentially prototyped a whiteboard feature inside AIRI
- **svg-whiteboard-mcp** — standalone MCP server that renders SVG-based whiteboards, usable as an agent tool
- **Shion Eria (詩音エリア)** — a parallel personal project: a custom digital companion built on the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/) framework, a separate runtime for "continuously existing AI assistants"

**PRs to main:** Yes — scale settings, whiteboard concept

**Why this matters:**
The OpenClaw + Shion Eria side project is the interesting thread. They appear to be building a parallel "character workspace persistence" system with different goals than AIRI's browser-first approach. OpenClaw is also the framework where the `NO_REPLY` / `HEARTBEAT_OK` directive convention originates. Worth watching their character architecture decisions as a design reference.

**Cherry-pick candidate:** `svg-whiteboard-mcp` — if AIRI ever wants an agent-driven whiteboard/canvas tool, this is already built.

## 🟡 Medium Interest — Check Periodically

### [btechioi/NOVA](https://github.com/btechioi/NOVA)

**What they're building:** Unknown — this fork was renamed from "airi" to **NOVA**, which is the strongest signal of intent to build a distinctly branded independent project rather than a staging branch for upstream PRs.

**PRs to main:** No evidence

**Why this matters:**
The rename is meaningful. Most forks that stay close to upstream don't rename. NOVA suggests a custom character or product vision. The repo has almost no indexed content (very new or intentionally minimal public presence), so confidence is low. Check back in a few weeks.

**Open question:** Is this someone building their own VTuber/companion character on the AIRI stack, or just a personal branding exercise?

### [BeanDz/airi](https://github.com/BeanDz/airi)

**What they're building:**
- Stage rendering architecture cleanup — replaced warpdrive plugin with unplug in stage-web/stage-ui
- Electron/Tamagotchi desktop mouse coordinate fixes

**PRs to main:** Yes — merged in v0.10.2

**Why this matters:**
Clean infrastructure contributor focused on the desktop rendering path. Their Electron coordinate work overlaps with areas dasilva333/airi has also touched. Low divergence, high upstream value. Not a cherry-pick target — their work flows back to main.

## 📌 Low Interest — Passive Forks

### [CaoMeiYouRen/airi](https://github.com/CaoMeiYouRen/airi)
**Background:** 草梅友仁 — prominent Chinese TypeScript developer and tech blogger known for RSS automation tools (`rss-impact-server`, `push-all-in-one`). Covers AIRI in Chinese developer newsletters on Juejin.

**Assessment:** Reference/observer fork. No code contributions detected. If they ever build something, it would likely be RSS/notification integration tooling — a natural fit given their background. On the radar as a future contributor, not an active one.

---

### [TheTechOddBug/airi](https://github.com/TheTechOddBug/airi)
**Background:** José María Gutiérrez — Spanish developer whose known activity is issue reports to VS Code, Yarn, and related tooling.

**Assessment:** Personal reference fork. No AIRI-specific contributions found. Safe to deprioritize.

## Key Observations

**The Alaya convergence is notable.** Two separate contributors (NashChennc and YoukiAkito) are actively working on the Alaya memory architecture upstream. This is the same problem space addressed in `PROPOSAL_Dynamic_Memory_RAG_Injection.md`. Their work may be worth evaluating once Alaya stabilizes — either as a foundation to build the RAG injection proposal on top of, or as a design reference to learn from and differentiate against.

**Most "forks" are just PR staging branches.** The real activity to track is not the fork repos themselves but the PRs and issues those contributors open on upstream moeru-ai/airi. The fork list is a contributor map, not a divergent-projects map.

**The dasilva333 ↔ upstream relationship requires pre-coordination for further contributions.** Three PRs were merged historically (smaller fixes). The Live2D engine in this fork is now so substantially ahead of main — and so deeply interconnected — that contributing it upstream isn't a simple PR. It would require: upstream maintainer agreement on scope and approach upfront, a dedicated feature branch from upstream main, and a lengthy review process with no guarantee of acceptance. The model is: upstream maintainers describe what they want and don't want, dasilva333 agrees on scope, then a PR gets submitted. Without that handshake, submitting a large-scope PR cold is a donation of engineering time with no guaranteed return. Upstream has been unresponsive on Discord to coordination attempts; this is the current blocker.

**Two genuinely independent forks:** dasilva333/airi (this one) and btechioi/NOVA (unconfirmed). The rest are upstream contributors using the standard fork-PR workflow.

**The competitive/inspiration dynamic mirrors the Shinobu situation.** NashChennc is building memory architecture from an LLM interpretability research angle; dasilva333 is building it from a product engineering angle. Neither is ahead on everything. The approaches are probably more complementary than competing.
