# Proposal: Flat Universe-Based Memory Isolation (Simplified Timeline Model)

This document outlines the simplified, flat **Universe-Based Memory Isolation** model for AIRI, which decouples conversation threads from the character memory banks. This design replaces the complex, Git-like nested tree inheritance model detailed in [timeline-nested-design.md](file:///docs/timeline-nested-design.md).

---

## 1. Architectural Pivot: Nested vs. Flat

In the previous nested architecture ([timeline-nested-design.md](file:///docs/timeline-nested-design.md)), conversation timelines were treated like branching Git commits, inheriting memory from ancestors using a recursive tree-climbing search engine.

While technically elegant, the nested model introduced significant practical issues:
1. **The New Session Dilemma**: Starting a fresh, empty conversation thread has no parent message turn. Linking it to a parent timeline to inherit memory was overly complex and unintuitive.
2. **Recursive Query Overhead**: Querying long-term memory (LTMM) required walking the parent timeline ancestry chain on every database scan, impacting performance.
3. **Compaction & Fork Fighting**: Branching conversations and daily memory summarization loops had to manage complex temporal barriers and inheritance gates.

### The Flat Solution: Decoupling Sessions from the Memory Bank
Instead of bound timelines, we introduce the concept of a **Universe** (or Group Slug):
* A **Universe** (`universeId` / `universeSlug`) is a flat boundary of shared memories, text journals, short-term blocks, echo chips, and lifetime artifacts.
* A **Chat Session** is a sequence of messages (dialogue history) associated with a single Universe.
* **Multiple Chat Sessions** can run concurrently inside the same Universe, sharing the same background memory and relationship status while maintaining independent chat bubbles.

```
                   [ UNIVERSE: "seaside-cottage-main" ]
                     /                              \
                    /                                \
       [ Chat Session A ]                     [ Chat Session B ]
    (Cozy Beach Hotpot Thread)             (Chloe Morning Escape Thread)
              |                                      |
              \--- Shared Memory Bank (LTMM, STMM) --/
```

## 2. Mapping the 6 Pillars of Memory to the Universe

By shifting to the Universe model, we simplify the database queries and data tagging across all 6 memory pillars:

| Memory Pillar | Storage Key / Location | Flat Universe Strategy | Schema Updates |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Chat Sessions** | `local:chat/sessions/{sessionId}` | Tagged with `universeId`. Multiple sessions can share the same `universeId`. | Add `universeId: string` to metadata. |
| **2. Text Journal (LTMM)** | `local:memory/text-journal/{userId}` | Each memory block is tagged with `universeId` and `sessionId`. Queries filter by `universeId`. | Add `universeId?: string` and `sessionId?: string` to `TextJournalEntry`. |
| **3. Short-Term Memory** | `local:memory/short-term/{userId}` | Daily summary blocks are tagged and queried by `universeId` and track original `sessionId`. | Add `universeId?: string` and `sessionId?: string` to `ShortTermMemoryBlock`. |
| **4. Echo Chips** | `local:memory/echo-chips/{userId}` | Emotional anchor chips are tagged and queried by `universeId`. | Add `universeId?: string` and `sessionId?: string` to `EchoChip`. |
| **5. Lifetime Artifact** | `local:memory/lifetime/{universeId}` | The synthesized character personality blueprint is isolated per `universeId`. | Keyed directly by `{universeId}`. |
| **6. Image Journal** | `localforage` index entries | Photo gallery metadata and custom backdrops are tagged by `universeId` and `sessionId`. | Add `universeId?: string` and `sessionId?: string` to `BackgroundEntry`. |

## 3. The Session Migration & Relinking Flow

Decoupling sessions and tagging individual memory elements with `sessionId` and `universeId` resolves a major implementation gap: **How do we migrate a storyline after the facts have already been created?**

In your Chloe GF Universe example:
1. You run a session under the default `"global"` universe. The AI writes text memories, generates selfies, and saves echo chips. All of them are saved with `sessionId = "{activeSessionId}"` and `universeId = "global"`.
2. You decide to isolate this timeline and switch the chat session to `"chloe-gf-uni"`.
3. **The Migration Resolver**:
   When the session's `universeId` is updated in the UI, the system runs a background migration transaction:
   * Query the Text Journal, STMM, Echo Chips, and Background stores for all entries matching `entry.sessionId === activeSessionId`.
   * Update their `universeId` property to `"chloe-gf-uni"`.
   * Persist the updated records.
4. **Outcome**: All text memories, daily summaries, emotional anchors, and generated gallery photos created during that session are cleanly pulled into the new universe. They disappear from the `"global"` timeline instantly, leaving the original universe completely untainted.

## 4. Core Database & Query Helpers

The query pipeline drops recursive ancestry checks entirely. The database filters become standard flat checks:

```typescript
// Proposed: packages/stage-ui/src/types/universe.ts
export interface Universe {
  id: string // Unique ID, e.g., "global", "seaside-alt"
  name: string // User-facing name, e.g., "Main Storyline", "Alternate Beach Path"
  characterId: string // The character card associated with this universe
  createdAt: number
}

// Proposed: Query Filter Helper
export function filterEntriesByUniverse<T extends { universeId?: string }>(
  entries: T[],
  activeUniverseId: string
): T[] {
  return entries.filter((entry) => {
    const entryUniverseId = entry.universeId || 'global'
    return entryUniverseId === activeUniverseId
  })
}
```
## 4. User-Facing UI Touchpoints & Workflows

### 4.1 The Common Universe Picker Dialog (`UniversePickerModal.vue`)
To keep the UI clean, elegant, and unified, we introduce a dedicated **Universe Picker Modal**. This modal acts as a value-returning dialog: it prompts the user to choose or create a universe, and on **Confirm**, it resolves and returns the selected `universeId` (slug) to the caller.

* **Modal Structure**:
  * **Header**: Title and clear subtext explaining what the choice affects.
  * **Spacious List of Existing Universes**: Rendered as large, clickable cards/list items (e.g. `Global`, `Seaside Cottage Alt`).
  * **Create New Section**: A dedicated text input box (`"Or, start a brand new universe:"`) with a `[ + Create New ]` button.
  * **Actions**: A `Cancel` button and a primary `Confirm` button.

### 4.2 Reused Workflow Entry Points

#### 4.2.1 Creating a New Chat Session
1. In the **Parallel Timelines** modal, the user clicks `+ Start New Timeline`.
2. This intercepts the auto-creation flow and immediately opens `UniversePickerModal` (defaulting to the active universe or `global`).
3. The user selects an existing universe or types a name to create a new one, then clicks **Confirm**.
4. The system creates the new session using the returned `universeId` and redirects to the chat.

#### 4.2.2 Forking a Conversation
1. The user right-clicks a message bubble and selects "Fork to Background" or "Fork and Switch".
2. The app compiles the copied messages and opens `UniversePickerModal` (defaulting to the parent timeline's current universe).
3. The user simply reviews and clicks **Confirm** to keep it in the same universe, or selects/creates a new one to branch memories.
4. The system forks the session under that selected `universeId`.

#### 4.2.3 Editing an Existing Session & Parallel Timelines List
We must allow users to retroactively assign or change a session's Universe:
* **The Universe Action Button**: In the **Parallel Timelines** modal (`ChatSessionModal.vue`), next to the `Edit Title (Pencil)` and `Delete (Trash)` buttons inside each session block, we add a new **Universe (Globe/Map) Icon Button**.
  * Clicking it opens `UniversePickerModal` pre-selected with that session's current universe.
  * Confirming the picker triggers the **Session Migration & Relinking Flow** (Section 3).
* **The Universe Badge**: Each session block in the Parallel Timelines list displays a flat styled **Universe Badge** (next to the message count) to indicate its active database context.
  * For example:
    * **Chloe as Girlfriend**
      * `Jun 15, 2026 13:34` | `[icon] 33 messages` | `[icon] chloe-uni-gf`
      * `Last active Jun 15, 2026 19:40`
    * **Seafood Syndicate**
      * `Jun 15, 2026 13:34` | `[icon] 39 messages` | `[icon] global`
      * `Last active Jun 15, 2026 17:06`

### 4.4 UI Component Queries
* **Echo Chips Ticker**: Filters chips by `activeSession.universeId`.
* **Latest Text Entries / DNA Snaps**: Renders memories matching the active session's `universeId`.
* **Stage Background Picker / Image Journal**: Presets and journal photos are filtered by `universeId`.

## 5. Background Processes & Prompt Construction

### 5.1 The Dreaming Daemon
The background proactivity loop (`evaluateDreamState`) collects conversation logs to synthesize daily memories. Under the Universe model, the collector queries only chat sessions matching the target `universeId`. The resulting summaries and text journal blocks are saved and tagged with that `universeId`.

### 5.2 System Prompt Construction
The prompt builder reads memories, short-term blocks, and synthesized lifetime artifacts that match the active session's `universeId`:
```typescript
const universeId = activeSession.value?.universeId || 'global'
const stmContext = shortTermMemory.getBlocksForUniverse(universeId)
const lifetimeArtifact = await lifetimeMemory.getArtifactForUniverse(universeId)
```

## 6. Design Agreement Summary

By adopting the flat **Universe** model:
1. We preserve complete narrative continuity across multiple parallel chat threads of the same "world."
2. We eliminate the recursive tree-traversal lookup bugs and timestamp math.
3. We naturally resolve how brand-new threads hook into existing memory states.
4. We keep the database layer flat, maintainable, and highly performant.

---

## 7. Backward Compatibility & Legacy Migration Heuristics

To ensure smooth operation when users upgrade from earlier versions of AIRI, the database layer implements fallback defaults and a one-time "Smart-Heal" routine on startup:

### 7.1 Fallback Defaulting
* All existing entries (Text Journal, STMM, Echo Chips, Backgrounds) that do not possess a `universeId` field are treated as part of the `"global"` universe.
* Query filters use the safe fallback expression: `entry.universeId || 'global'`.

### 7.2 Smart-Heal Migration Heuristic
To allow legacy chat histories to be migrated to new universes in the future, the system must bind existing `null`-sessionId memory entries to their corresponding sessions. On boot, the migration manager inspects the sessions list per character:
1. **Single-Session Character**: If a character has **exactly one** chat session in their history, the system updates all legacy memories, daily blocks, and background images for that character, setting their `sessionId` to that single session's ID.
2. **Multi-Session Character**: If a character has **two or more** chat sessions in their history, their legacy memory `sessionId` fields are left as `null`. This prevents misattribution of memories, leaving them safely shared in the `"global"` memory pool.
